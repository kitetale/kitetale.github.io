My main interest lies in special effects, interactive design, and immersive media. I look forward to learning more about the state of art technical animation tools and algorithms and potentially apply or use those tools in my personal practice/projects.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>January 23, 2023 (Mon)</h2>\n            <p>\n                Going over walk cycle and motion capture was a good review for me, as the last time I worked with these was last spring semester (S22). Although I've seen many of the applications of motion capture data, I haven't really looked into the data file itself before. Looking into what the motion capture data file looks like made me appreciate once again of the already developed opensource parsers.  \n            </p>\n\n            <h2>January 25, 2023 (Wed)</h2>\n            <p>\n                Learning about different implementation methods for IK in class today was highly valuable to me. All I knew regarding Jacobian was the basics that we briefly covered in Computer Graphics course, so walking through the paper on different applications of Jacobian and pseudoinverse was very helpful. Perhaps I can try implementing these for the second part of the first mini project? \n            </p>\n\n            <h2>January 30, 2023 (Mon)</h2>\n            <p>\n                It was interesting to see how Jacobian transpose relates to gradient descent. However, I don't know if I fully understand the transition from the equation we covered last class to the one we covered today, as I don't see how subtracting the offset gives similar result. Or was it suppose to mean that the gradient descent gives higher accuracy because it's subtracting the offset amount of a part that shouldn't be shifting? I also realized during today's class that I was misunderstanding the use of rotational axis in last class when it's used to cross with the distance from joint to end point (r_i). I appreciate how material we cover in class build onto each other instead of introducing new topic each time. This way gives me time to sit with the topic we covered in class and review again during the following class to strengthen understanding. Also, it assimiliates how researches are done (i.e. build onto previously released paper and compare & contrast).\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default technicalanimation","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport var center = \"ResumePage-module--center--9b0dd\";\nexport var content = \"ResumePage-module--content--dfefc\";\nexport var content2 = \"ResumePage-module--content2--e4fd6\";\nexport var footDescrip = \"ResumePage-module--footDescrip--5a6f4\";\nexport var footer = \"ResumePage-module--footer--ef519\";\nexport var overall = \"ResumePage-module--overall--a999b\";\nexport var resumeStyle = \"ResumePage-module--resumeStyle--64bc2\";\nexport var title = \"ResumePage-module--title--acc5f\";\nexport var title3 = \"ResumePage-module--title3--2ba8f\";"],"names":["rel","type","href","favicon","className","overall","content2","center","content","footDescrip","footer","resumeStyle","title"],"sourceRoot":""}
