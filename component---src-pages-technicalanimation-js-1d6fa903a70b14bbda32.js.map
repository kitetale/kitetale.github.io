My main interest lies in special effects, interactive design, and immersive media. I look forward to learning more about the state of art technical animation tools and algorithms and potentially apply or use those tools in my personal practice/projects.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>January 23, 2023 (Mon)</h2>\n            <p>\n                Going over walk cycle and motion capture was a good review for me, as the last time I worked with these was last spring semester (S22). Although I've seen many of the applications of motion capture data, I haven't really looked into the data file itself before. Looking into what the motion capture data file looks like made me appreciate once again of the already developed opensource parsers.  \n            </p>\n\n            <h2>January 25, 2023 (Wed)</h2>\n            <p>\n                Learning about different implementation methods for IK in class today was highly valuable to me. All I knew regarding Jacobian was the basics that we briefly covered in Computer Graphics course, so walking through the paper on different applications of Jacobian and pseudoinverse was very helpful. Perhaps I can try implementing these for the second part of the first mini project? \n            </p>\n\n            <h2>January 30, 2023 (Mon)</h2>\n            <p>\n                It was interesting to see how Jacobian transpose relates to gradient descent. However, I don't know if I fully understand the transition from the equation we covered last class to the one we covered today, as I don't see how subtracting the offset gives similar result. Or was it suppose to mean that the gradient descent gives higher accuracy because it's subtracting the offset amount of a part that shouldn't be shifting? I also realized during today's class that I was misunderstanding the use of rotational axis in last class when it's used to cross with the distance from joint to end point (r_i). I appreciate how material we cover in class build onto each other instead of introducing new topic each time. This way gives me time to sit with the topic we covered in class and review again during the following class to strengthen understanding. Also, it assimiliates how researches are done (i.e. build onto previously released paper and compare & contrast).\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>February 1, 2023 (Wed)</h2>\n            <p>\n               To me, rigging and skinning always have been the 'required' steps that I just had to do to get to the fun animation part. Learning about RigNet and Neural Blend Shapes for rigging and skinning was useful, as it seemed highly practical and time-saving. I still wonder how these models were trained, specifically how blend shapes are predicted. Based on my previous experience, blend shapes still rely on the initial rigging and skinning that's done on the rest A or T pose of the character, then set a certain pose as the end pose for the blend shape. However, the Neural Blend Shapes paper seemed to imply that these blend shapes can be trainned in a different manner than how RigNet trains to predict where the rig would be located and mesh weights would be distributed. Although my main interest lies in visual effects and simulation, I think it would be interesting to further look into the papers on automated rigging and skinning.  \n            </p>\n\n            <h2>February 6, 2023 (Mon)</h2>\n            <p>\n              Motion capture lab visit was a good review session, although since it was my third time there as a class, I wasn't surprised with anything new. I'm still unclear if I would use motion capture lab for the final project, but I'm glad to know that it's available as an option if I need to capture any motion. Learning about Arjun's paper on figuring out the hand gesture by area indication on mesh was highly interesting, as I haven't thought about defining a hand gesture based on a contact area between the two mesh. I think in general learning about what techniques are out there opens up the perspective on how one can see the same problem form different angles and focus.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>February 8, 2023 (Wed)</h2>\n            <p>\n               First paper presentations today. Again, I find these paper presentations really crucial and useful, as I get to have exposures to various techniques out there without having to fully dive into the paper and all the math. The non-Euclidean space paper was highly interesting, as I've seen its applications across various video games but didn't really know much about the concept and math behind it. I also wouldn't have known about it since I couldn't tell that the paper discussed such a topic only from the title. (i.e. I didn't know such portal effect and dimension changing was called non-Euclidean space...)\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default technicalanimation","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport var center = \"ResumePage-module--center--9b0dd\";\nexport var content = \"ResumePage-module--content--dfefc\";\nexport var content2 = \"ResumePage-module--content2--e4fd6\";\nexport var footDescrip = \"ResumePage-module--footDescrip--5a6f4\";\nexport var footer = \"ResumePage-module--footer--ef519\";\nexport var overall = \"ResumePage-module--overall--a999b\";\nexport var resumeStyle = \"ResumePage-module--resumeStyle--64bc2\";\nexport var title = \"ResumePage-module--title--acc5f\";\nexport var title3 = \"ResumePage-module--title3--2ba8f\";"],"names":["rel","type","href","favicon","className","overall","content2","center","content","footDescrip","footer","resumeStyle","title"],"sourceRoot":""}
