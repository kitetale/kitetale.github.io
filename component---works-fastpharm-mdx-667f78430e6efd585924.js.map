a world where everything can be easily ordered and delivered to the front of one's door with a couple of button presses, ordering a delivery from a local pharmacy should not be any harder. However, to a surprise, ordering a delivery from a local pharmacy is <b> not as common as ordering deliveries from a supermarket or a restaurant </b>   -- whenever pharmaceutical products are in need, people typically go to the pharmacy in person or ask a friend a favor. Although delivery apps for local pharmacies are not widely used or well-known, it is obvious that such a service would be highly beneficial for increasing efficiency and convenience, just as other delivery apps do.\n          <p>{`Interested in `}<b>{` investigating the public's interaction and experience with pharmacy delivery apps `}</b>{`, we researched and designed a responsive user interface for the online pharmacy delivery order platform.`}</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className={infos}>\n        <div className={info}>\n          <div>\n            <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Team `}</strong></p>\n          </div>\n          <div className={closerLineHeight}> \nAshley Kim <br /> Michelle Lu <br /> Preethi Surapaneni\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className={info}> \n          <div>\n            <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Role`}</strong></p>\n          </div>\n          <div className={closerLineHeight}> \nUI/UX design <br /> UX research <br /> pitch presentation\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className={info}>\n          <div>\n            <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Duration `}</strong></p>\n          </div>\n          <div className={closerLineHeight}> \nNov 9 - Dec 9, 2021 <br /> (1 month)\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className={info}>\n          <div>\n            <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Tool `}</strong></p>\n          </div>\n          <div className={closerLineHeight}> \nFigma\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className={subTitle} style={{\n      \"borderBottom\": \"3px solid #5B74F7\",\n      \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n    }}>\nChallenge\n    </div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"width\": \"fit-content\",\n      \"margin\": \"auto\",\n      \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n    }}>\n      <p style={{\n        \"borderLeft\": \"solid 1rem\",\n        \"padding\": \"1rem 0\",\n        \"borderColor\": \"#5B74F7\",\n        \"backgroundColor\": \"#E3E6F8\",\n        \"height\": \"fit-content\",\n        \"margin\": \"0\"\n      }}>\n        <blockquote>\n          <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`How can we improve the user experience of the online pharmacy delivery application for a wider usage?`}</p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n    }}>\nThe best way to learn about current user's experience is through interviews with the current users. Hence, to capture users' current experience and identify the opportunities for improvement, we seeked for several users who have ordered a pharmaceutical products delivery from an online platform to hear about their personal experience with the applications. Finding the rapid research participants was much harder than we expected, as more people than we thought never used or heard any pharmacy delivery applications. \n    </div>\n    <div className={subTitle} style={{\n      \"borderBottom\": \"3px solid #5B74F7\"\n    }}>\n  Early Stage Rapid Research\n    </div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n    }}>\n  Since well-defined goals, plans, and actions serve as a clear guideline\n  throughout the design process, we first developed our own prior to conducting\n  interviews.

This was also the first time I've tried paper prototyping, which I experienced its merit in that it is disposable and easy to make without any particular skills in advance. Previous to this project, I thought paper prototyping is not as useful in gaining user insights due to the playful feel the paper craft naturally contains, or as shareable compared to the quick (in my opinion) mockups on interface design tools like Figma or Adobe XD. Despite my worries, <b>paper prototypes brought valuable user insights</b> during the think aloud user testing sessions. Personally, I don't think I'd be using paper prototypes as often for the clearer communication purpose (oftentimes one's handwriting isn't legible to all). However, with the experience of conducting think aloud user testing using the paper prototype, I think <b>I'll be able to quickly mock up a design using paper prototype when needed</b> -- It sure is a useful skill to have!\n      <p>{`Overall, I `}<b>{`enjoyed trying new methods`}</b>{` throughout the process of developing a responsive web design for the pharmacy delivery platform. Focusing on a specific portion of the design, in this case improving a search mechenism, definitely allowed us to visually communicate with others and give a firm understanding of how other parts of the platform may be designed in the pitch. If chance in the future, I’d like to explore integrating other features that we discussed during ideation like notification system and prescription scanning feature.`}</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      ","export default function _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) {\n  if (source == null) return {};\n  var target = {};\n  var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);\n  var key, i;\n  for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) {\n    key = sourceKeys[i];\n    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue;\n    target[key] = source[key];\n  }\n  return target;\n}"],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","className","infogrid","overview","parentName","closerLineHeight","infos","info","subTitle","style","src","plan","alt","procon","procon2","cjm","userflow","paper","wireframe","midfi","threeGrid2","autoPlay","loop","muted","disablePictureInPicture","controlsList","playsInline","allowFullScreen","video","search","type","elem2","threeGrid","rec","realtime","isMDXComponent","_objectWithoutPropertiesLoose","source","excluded","key","i","target","sourceKeys","Object","keys","length","indexOf"],"sourceRoot":""}
