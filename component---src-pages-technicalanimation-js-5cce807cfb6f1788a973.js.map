My main interest lies in special effects, interactive design, and immersive media. I look forward to learning more about the state of art technical animation tools and algorithms and potentially apply or use those tools in my personal practice/projects.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>January 23, 2023 (Mon)</h2>\n            <p>\n                Going over walk cycle and motion capture was a good review for me, as the last time I worked with these was last spring semester (S22). Although I've seen many of the applications of motion capture data, I haven't really looked into the data file itself before. Looking into what the motion capture data file looks like made me appreciate once again of the already developed opensource parsers.  \n            </p>\n\n            <h2>January 25, 2023 (Wed)</h2>\n            <p>\n                Learning about different implementation methods for IK in class today was highly valuable to me. All I knew regarding Jacobian was the basics that we briefly covered in Computer Graphics course, so walking through the paper on different applications of Jacobian and pseudoinverse was very helpful. Perhaps I can try implementing these for the second part of the first mini project? \n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default technicalanimation","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport var center = \"ResumePage-module--center--9b0dd\";\nexport var content = \"ResumePage-module--content--dfefc\";\nexport var content2 = \"ResumePage-module--content2--e4fd6\";\nexport var footDescrip = \"ResumePage-module--footDescrip--5a6f4\";\nexport var footer = \"ResumePage-module--footer--ef519\";\nexport var overall = \"ResumePage-module--overall--a999b\";\nexport var resumeStyle = \"ResumePage-module--resumeStyle--64bc2\";\nexport var title = \"ResumePage-module--title--acc5f\";\nexport var title3 = \"ResumePage-module--title3--2ba8f\";"],"names":["rel","type","href","favicon","className","overall","content2","center","content","footDescrip","footer","resumeStyle","title"],"sourceRoot":""}
