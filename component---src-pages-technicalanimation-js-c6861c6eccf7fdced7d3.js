However, I don't know if I fully understand the transition from the equation we covered last class to the one we covered today, as I don't see how subtracting the offset gives similar result. Or was it suppose to mean that the gradient descent gives higher accuracy because it's subtracting the offset amount of a part that shouldn't be shifting? I also realized during today's class that I was misunderstanding the use of rotational axis in last class when it's used to cross with the distance from joint to end point (r_i). I appreciate how material we cover in class build onto each other instead of introducing new topic each time. This way gives me time to sit with the topic we covered in class and review again during the following class to strengthen understanding. Also, it assimiliates how researches are done (i.e. build onto previously released paper and compare & contrast)."))))}},1606:function(e,t,a){a.d(t,{Mv:function(){return s},OA:function(){return l},S2:function(){return c},TN:function(){return u},be:function(){return n},dI:function(){return r},kQ:function(){return o},q4:function(){return i}});var n="ResumePage-module--center--9b0dd",o="ResumePage-module--content--dfefc",i="ResumePage-module--content2--e4fd6",r="ResumePage-module--footDescrip--5a6f4",s="ResumePage-module--footer--ef519",l="ResumePage-module--overall--a999b",c="ResumePage-module--resumeStyle--64bc2",u="ResumePage-module--title--acc5f"}}]);
