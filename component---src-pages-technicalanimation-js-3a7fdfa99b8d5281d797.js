I also realized during today's class that I was misunderstanding the use of rotational axis in last class when it's used to cross with the distance from joint to end point (r_i). I appreciate how material we cover in class build onto each other instead of introducing new topic each time. This way gives me time to sit with the topic we covered in class and review again during the following class to strengthen understanding.

Learning about RigNet and Neural Blend Shapes for rigging and skinning was useful, as it seemed highly practical and time-saving. I still wonder how these models were trained, specifically how blend shapes are predicted. Based on my previous experience, blend shapes still rely on the initial rigging and skinning that's done on the rest A or T pose of the character, then set a certain pose as the end pose for the blend shape. However, the Neural Blend Shapes paper seemed to imply that these blend shapes can be trainned in a different manner than how RigNet trains to predict where the rig would be located and mesh weights would be distributed. Although my main interest lies in visual effects and simulation, I think it would be interesting to further look into the papers on automated rigging and skinning."))))}},1606:function(e,t,n){n.d(t,{Mv:function(){return r},OA:function(){return l},S2:function(){return c},TN:function(){return d},be:function(){return a},dI:function(){return s},kQ:function(){return i},q4:function(){return o}});var a="ResumePage-module--center--9b0dd",i="ResumePage-module--content--dfefc",o="ResumePage-module--content2--e4fd6",s="ResumePage-module--footDescrip--5a6f4",r="ResumePage-module--footer--ef519",l="ResumePage-module--overall--a999b",c="ResumePage-module--resumeStyle--64bc2",d="ResumePage-module--title--acc5f"}}]);
