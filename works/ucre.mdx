## Challenge ##
> #### How can we address safety when solo travelers are planning their trip? ####

<br/><br/>

## Methods ##
We conducted various user experience research methods with voluntary participants who have done a solo travel to another location in the past. Below are the methods we utilized to gather data:
> <ul className='image-grid'>
    <li> Directed Storytelling</li>
    <li> Speed Dating</li>
    <li> Affinity Clustering</li>
    <li> Empathy Mapping</li>
    <li> Customer Journey Mapping</li>
    <li> Semi-structured Interview</li>
    <li> Contextual Inquiry</li>
    <li> Storyboarding</li>
    <li> Data Analysis</li>
</ul>
<br/>

## Problem ##
Based on our research, we discovered that solo travelers are  open to (sometimes even looking to) connect with others who are going to the same events or activities as them; however, solo travelers are also concerned with their safety when it comes to meeting those new people. Essentially, **solo travelers want to feel safe when meeting new people. **
