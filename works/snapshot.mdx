## Snapshot is a Kinect-based project that displays a composite image of what was captured over time through depth.  ##
<br/>
Each layer that builds up the image contains the outline of objects captured at different depth range at different time. The layers are organized by time, meaning the oldest capture is at the background and the newest capture is at the foreground.
<br/>

**Tool:** openFrameworks, Kinect, Thermal Printer <br/>
**Duration:** 2 weeks (Nov.22 - Dec.6.2022) <br/>
