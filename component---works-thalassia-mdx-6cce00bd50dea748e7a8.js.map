The exhibition presented more than six collaborative works by <b>more than 50 animators, dancers, and musicians</b> in the evening of December 3, 2021.\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <img style={{\n        \"width\": \"100%\",\n        \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n      }} src={poster} alt={\"poster of exhibition 'Between Air and Waterlines'\"} />\n    </div>\n    <div className={subTitle}>\nConcept Ideation\n    </div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n    }}>\nAs a team of three, we began ideating for the overarching theme of our piece. Wanting to create an immersive environment that's different than what we experience in our daily lives, I proposed creating an <b>immersive underwater environment</b>. Other team members agreed to the concept, and we start narrowing down the narrative of the piece by researching how underwater is depicted in different media and genres.\n    </div>\n    <div className={subTitle}>\nResearch\n    </div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n    }}>\nThrough the research, we noticed that underwater has been used in various context with different feel for centuries. Below are examples of how underwater has been portrayed in certain fields and media:\n      <h2 style={{\n        \"marginTop\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nGreek Mythology\n      </h2>\n      <div style={{\n        \"paddingLeft\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nSince Greek mythology explains the creations and stories of different Earth elements, numerous characters from Greek mythology were related to the body of water. Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> is a representative piece of literature that unfolds the adventure of Greek hero Odysseus. Calypso is a sea nymph who detained Odysseus for seven years, while Sirens are man-bird creatures who lure nearby sailors with their enchanting music to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. Poseidon is a famous god of the sea, and Kraken is a legendary sea monster of gigantic sized cephalopod-like creature that often appears in the Scandinavian folklore. \n        <p>{`From the Greek mythological stories and characters, we gained the impression that underwater is often portrayed as a `}<b className={orange}>{`realm of curiosity`}</b>{`, `}<b className={orange}>{`enchantment`}</b>{`, and `}<b className={orange}>{`danger`}</b>{`.`}</p>\n      </div>\n      <h2 style={{\n        \"marginTop\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nUnderwater Organisms\n      </h2>\n      <div style={{\n        \"paddingLeft\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nAdapting to the higher pressured deep ocean habitat, underwater organisms have unique body features that helps them survive better. Survival mechanisms similar to that of the land organisms like camouflage can be found amongst the underwater organisms as well, but they also have unique underwater features that are distinct to those in the land. Blobfish, for example, are well-known for their melting look after being pulled up rapidly by the fishers. However, they look totally different in their natural habitat, which is more than 3,000 feet below the sea level. Anglerfish are famous for their method of predation in the deep sea. They have bioluminescent lures protruding from their heads to attract prey to come near them. Prey fish would mistaken the lights and approach the anglerfish without being on alert. Humans also have mistaken a number of underwater organisms in the past, and mistaking manatees for mermaids is the most well-known fun fact introduced at the aquariums. \n        <p>{`From researching various underwater organisms, we learned that `}<b className={orange}>{`misinterpretation`}</b>{` is the repeating theme in both underwater survivalship and human understanding of deep ocean organisms.`}</p>\n      </div>\n      <h2 style={{\n        \"marginTop\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nMysteries\n      </h2>\n      <div style={{\n        \"paddingLeft\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nSome of the famous mysteries around the world are related to the deep ocean. Bermuda Triangle, for instance, is a mythical section of the Atlantic Ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. It is a notorious region where dozens of ships and airplanes have disappeared in the past. Atlantis is a fictional city mentioned in Plato's literature *Timaeus and Critias* that is well-known as the sunken city. \n        <p>{`Underwater related mysteries gave us similar impression as the Greek mythology research, where the underwater has been portrayed as a place that's `}<b className={orange}>{`full of wonders and danger`}</b>{`.`}</p>\n      </div>\n      <h2 style={{\n        \"marginTop\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nMedia\n      </h2>\n      <div style={{\n        \"paddingLeft\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nSince the exhibition would be held indoor on land, we had to find a way to recreate the underwater feel inside a building. Computer graphics and visual effects used in media often uses shots on land as the base footage, so we researched how the underwater scenes in movies depict the feel of water. Through the scenes from <i>Harry Potter</i> and <i>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</i>, we noticed that <b className={orange}>blue green tint, air bubbles, and water caustics</b> are used to visually persuade the underwater scene. Billie Eilish's music video for <i>Ilomilo</i> is a moving image animation set in a deep ocean, which we gained the inspiration of <b className={orange}>sinking movement direction</b> from.\n      </div>\n      <h2 style={{\n        \"marginTop\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nVideo Games\n      </h2>\n      <div style={{\n        \"paddingLeft\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nFor the interactivity aspect of the project, we also looked up how underwater themed games have designed their player experience. Some of the games we viewed are <i>Subnautica</i>, a survival game, <i>Reveal the Deep</i>, a short exploration game, <i>Soma</i>, a survival game with mini puzzles, and <i>Lumione</i>, an exploration game. Many of the games that gave immersive experience was developed in a first person shooter game style, where the user gains <b className={orange}>full control of what to see and where to go</b>.\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div className={subTitle}>\nConcept Finalization\n    </div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n    }}>\nCombining what we found through the research, we decided to create an <b>interative underwater environment</b> that revolves around the theme of <b className={orange}>pressure</b>, <b className={orange}>shape-shifting</b>, and <b className={orange}>distortion of reality</b>. \n    </div>\n    <div className={subTitle}>\nProduction\n    </div>\n    <div style={{\n      \"marginBottom\": \"3rem\"\n    }}>\nMaximizing each of the member's strength, I was in charge of <b>project management</b>, <b>interaction design</b>, and <b>installation design</b>.\n      <h2 style={{\n        \"marginTop\": \"3rem\"\n      }}>\nProject Management\n      </h2>\n      <img style={{\n        \"width\": \"100%\",\n        \"marginBottom\": \"1rem\"\n      }} src={timeline} alt={\"Timeline of Thalassia production\"} />\n      <div>\nWe first developed a overarching timeline together to <b>set checkpoints as a smaller deadlines</b>.

Many viewers were <b>amazed and showed great interest</b> in their silhouette appearing as part of water caustics. Although there were various aspects that I had to compromise due to the location specific limitation, I'm proud of our work and installation. Through this project, I was able to practice my project management skills, especially on <b>deciding which aspect of the project to prioritize given an abrupt time and space limit</b>. Since the interactivity gained high interest during the event, my team and I are planning to have another exhibition in a smaller exhibition space where the audience can fully immerse themselves surrounded by the underwater visuals. \n      <p>{`I'd like to express my appreciation to professor Johannes DeYoung, Rebecca Shapass, professor Golan Levin, and Bill Rodgers for their generous support in bringing this project together.  `}</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      ","export default function _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) {\n  if (source == null) return {};\n  var target = {};\n  var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source);\n  var key, i;\n  for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) {\n    key = sourceKeys[i];\n    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue;\n    target[key] = source[key];\n  }\n  return target;\n}"],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","className","infogrid","overview","parentName","closerLineHeight","infos","info","subTitle","style","src","poster","alt","orange","timeline","threeGrid","autoPlay","loop","muted","disablePictureInPicture","controlsList","playsInline","allowFullScreen","water","type","elem2","threeGrid2","particle","combine","combined","twoGrid","test1","test2","sketch2","sketch3","install","overview1","interaction","isMDXComponent","_objectWithoutPropertiesLoose","source","excluded","key","i","target","sourceKeys","Object","keys","length","indexOf"],"sourceRoot":""}
